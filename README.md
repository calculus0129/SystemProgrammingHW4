# SystemProgrammingHW4

I'll now divide the procedure as follows:

My Homework Plan:
1. Allocate 64 bytes of memory and enable representing a SHORT value.
    1. make a printing function of the ‘dump memory’.
    2. Enable representing a variable with name.
2. Make the IO to work.
3. Enable representing many variables of various types.
    1. Enable 'safe' allocation
4. Output the data (names) I have right now.
5. Enable deallocation.
6. Enable representing a struct.
7. Additional Features: ‘corner cases’
    1. e.g. enable other types (e.g. int, double, etc.)
    2. e.g. handling allocation of data with already allocated name.
    3. e.g. Checking invalid type name
    4. e.g. Checking invalid variable name.
    5. e.g. Checking invalid input.
