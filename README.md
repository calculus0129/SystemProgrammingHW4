I'll now divide the procedure as follows:

My Homework Plan:
1. Allocate 64 bytes of memory and enable representing an int value.
    가. make a printing function of the ‘dump memory’.
2. Enable representing a variable with name.
3. Enable representing many int variables.
    가. Enable deallocation,
    나. And ‘safe’ deallocation.
4. Enable representing many variables of various types to represent.
5. Enable representing a struct.
6. Enable safe allocation. (prevent memory ‘overflowing’)
7. Additional Features: ‘corner cases’
    가. e.g. Checking invalid type name
    나. e.g. Checking invalid variable name.
    다. e.g. Checking invalid input.
