# SystemProgrammingHW4

## Usage

1. Download these
2. Access the folder in the CLI and run 'make'
    * 'make' would work if it is installed.
    * Else, you have to do install something for 'make',
    * or you can just run the code with gcc, using the content of the Makefile.
3. Execute the ELF 'pgm'
    * command for Linux: ./pgm


## Development Procedure

I'll now divide the procedure as follows:

My Homework Plan:
<span style="font-color:green;font-weight:700;font-size:20px">
1. Allocate 64 bytes of memory and enable representing a SHORT value.
    1. make a printing function of the ‘dump memory’.
    2. Enable representing a variable with name.
2. Make the IO to work.
3. Enable representing many variables of various types.
    1. Enable 'safe' allocation
4. Output the data (names) I have right now.
</span>
<span style="font-color:black;font-weight:700;font-size:20px">
5. Enable deallocation.
6. Enable representing a struct.
7. Additional Features: ‘corner cases’
    1. e.g. enable other types (e.g. int, double, etc.)
    2. e.g. handling allocation of data with already allocated name.
    3. e.g. Checking invalid type name
    4. e.g. Checking invalid variable name.
    5. e.g. Checking invalid input.
